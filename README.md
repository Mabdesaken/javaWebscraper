#BIG PROBLEM WITH WEBSCRAPING BILIBILI/YOUTUBE ETC.

This is a webscraper that scrapes a certain bilibili video(can be changed). However, the way a webscraper works is by sending a request to bilibili's server asking for the HTML. But much like Youtube, Bilibili doesn't want you to scrape their videos for comments, it is easy to fetch other data, but the comments isn't sent in the HTML. 

This is a link to scraping youtube: https://blog.apify.com/how-to-scrape-youtube/

In this link it will show that you have to sign up for google dev services and use a specific API that they have approved. I suspect that the same goes for Bilibili,  but the problem lies for a western coder that it is super hard to gain any information about bilibili through google, since it is not a chinese webbrowser, and I suspect that understanding how to make a bilibili webscraper is much easier to research from a Chinese webbrowser. 

TLDR: Bilibili doesn't return comments when scraping, and isn't really possible with western information.
